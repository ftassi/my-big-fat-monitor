# My Big Fat Monitor

My Big Fat Monitor is a 49" ultrawide display—definitely too big to be used as a single screen or to be shared during pair programming sessions.

The scripts in this repository allow you to split the screen into multiple virtual monitors, so you can better organize your workspace.

## Usage

Running `make install` will install the scripts in `~/.local/bin`.

The available scripts are:

- **xrandr-3-way**: Splits the screen into three parts—a central 16:10 section and two side monitors.
- **xrandr-third**: Splits the screen into thirds, assigning one third to the left and two thirds to the right.
- **xrandr-half**: Splits the screen into two equal halves.
- **xrandr-ultrawide**: Creates a single virtual screen that spans the entire monitor.
- **xrandr-reset**: Resets the screen to its default configuration.

## My monitor

The monitor is a Dell U4919DW with a resolution of 5120x1440
